With CycleCloud 8 now supporting Cloud-Init as a means of configuring VMs it seemed appropriate to look at using cloud-init in the deployment of CycleCloud itself

This example is more fully featured as it will also deploy the storage acocunt, register the ccadmin user and the Azure subscription in CycleCloud
